# VADER_Dissertation
My code and data for my dissertation on misogyny towards female UK politicians. Coding is done in R.

The functions defined in the script should be the same as the API requests seen on the X API documentation

I have included my scrape file, userdata scrape file, and vader sentiment package file. 

I am in the process of including my data cleaning file which is to be used prior to implementing vader analysis.

Finally, I will include the code I used to create the data visualisations for my dissertation.

All code is in its most flexible form (the code I used for my dissertation was specific for each politician with addtiional meta data which was manually scraaped and implemented. This will make more sense once the data visualisation files are uploaded as each preset would be altered to only call data pertaining to certain tweet recipients.
